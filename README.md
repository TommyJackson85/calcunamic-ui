# calcunamic-ui

Creating an open source React.js library for building calculation UI components, used for regular, financial, scientific calculations. Potential uses for them are for developing advanced form inputs used for calculations and building in built calculators for apps and websites, creating storage components to store calculations. 

Check out the [Calcunamic-UI Example](https://tommyjackson85.github.io/calcunamic-ui/) in which utilises a Budget Marker and a potential assistant calculator.

Early stages of this project can be found at this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/TommyJackson85/interactive-calculator), in which I built a [hosted interactive calculator](https://tommyjackson85.github.io/interactive-calculator/). It also includes a temporary database and a fully expanded calculation screen. This was a college project I built to try and come up with new ideas for building calculation applications. 

Currently I am looking for ideas that will bennefit the developer community with the long term plan to make this for commercial applications. In the mean time I plan on starting small with this application. I will first create a basic calculator using React.js, Node.js, MongoDB and GraphQL.

The initial ideas for this library may change over time. For example, if I feel they have no relevence, or are just reinventing the wheel, I will forget them.

## Contributions

I am looking for documentation ideas and questions at the moment only. Feel free to post an Issue in relation to this.

Right now, while this is in its prototype phase, I have to garner ideas on how to make this project relevent.
